    "Job Description": "<div class=\"column main \">\n<p>Are you a dedicated Frontend Developer?</p>\n<p>So, you started learning Frontend Development in the beginning\u2026 trying to understand vanillaJS (JS as a standard), CSS and HTML, then moved on with ES6/7 JS. Someday you discovered the new age frameworks (React, Vue,\u2026) and you have been learning and thought that React as a library is nothing more than </p>\n<ul>\n<li>some lifecycles to understand, </li>\n<li>JSX templating, </li>\n<li>Props and State.</li>\n</ul><p>... and that was mostly it\u2026 But then it started to get interesting with different patterns like Render Props, HoC, functional programming\u2026 Putting in the mix React Router, Redux with different middlewares like Thunk, Saga, Observables\u2026. You thought about immutability problems, unit testing with Jest and Enzyme, handling translations with Polyglot. </p>\n<p>And when you finally got all of this, you needed to start thinking how you can put this together\u2026 And here came Babel and Webpack in place\u2026 And of course before all of these, you needed to make sure about coding standards and that everyone is coding in the same way with Linters, EditorConfig, Formatters\u2026 </p>\n<p>Then, once you thought you have all of the above under your belt, you thought you have it all and that was it, but you could not be more wrong. You need to constantly follow the community and be in line with the new and upcoming solutions. For example, a few weeks ago, a new \u201cReach Router\u201d for React was announced, which seems quite good and a valid alternative to React Router. All of the above libraries and bundlers are evolving day by day and you still keep track on what\u2019s happening so that you won\u2018t be left behind\u2026 </p>\n<p>Congratulations! That\u2018s exactly why we want you in our team.</p>\n<p>Why CREALOGIX?</p>\n<p>Have you ever thought about what makes you laugh? Humorous friends, delicious food or even challenging tasks?

Founded in 2010, we set out to make Git\u2019s powerful feature set accessible to developers, designers, and non-technical people.\u2028</p>\n<p><strong>Today, our software Tower is the best Git client for Mac and Windows and is used by over 100,000 customers - from startups to Fortune 100 companies.</strong></p>\n<p>We know we can achieve great goals only with the help of our peers. And at fournova, we are blessed to work in a team of extraordinary people.\u2028 We\u2019re not looking for someone to do the job. We\u2019re looking for someone to join the team.</p>\n<h3>Values at fournova</h3>\n<p>We are a team driven by values. Not the ones that look nice on a poster, but ones that are truly and honestly lived.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>TRUST</strong>\u00a0- We believe our colleagues make good &amp; fair decisions.\u2028 For example when they take as many vacation days as they need (there's no maximum number of holidays, but a minimum of 24 days). Or when they handle company money responsibly (you can make any purchases without asking for permission). We don't control or micro-manage people.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>RELIABILITY</strong>\u00a0- At fournova, you're allowed to make any decision.\u2028 Even if it's outside of your typical scope of duty. As a consequence, however, you also have to accept responsibility. We rely on our teammates to do their very best work.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>RESPECT</strong>\u00a0- We have a deep and sincere respect for each other.\u2028 Both on a professional and on a personal level. We know we can achieve great goals only with the help of our peers.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>HUMILITY</strong>\u00a0- We do what's best for the team.\u2028 This shows when you're supporting a team decision even if you'd prefer something else. And this shows when making profits: we donate 10% to a good cause every year.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>HEALTH</strong>\u00a0- We require everyone to give 100%.\u2028 But not more than that! Working long hours or weekends is rarely seen at fournova. If you want, you can even choose to work only a 4-day week. We encourage you to pursue a life beyond work!</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>PRAGMATISM</strong>\u00a0- We concentrate on the tasks that matter.\u2028 Many things at fournova could be improved. But reality limits our time and energy in a painful way. To get meaningful work done, we need to live with countless little annoyances and concentrate on the things that bring us forward.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>\u00a0- All of us have a strong desire to grow.\u2028 And fournova wants to help you achieve this. On the professional and on the personal, human level.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>REMOTE WORK</strong>\u00a0- We are strong believers in freedom &amp; flexibility. Therefore, you can work from wherever you want. In order to keep in touch, however, we meet in person at least once every quarter: for our \"General Assemblies\" in Frankfurt or Berlin, and for our great team retreats in places like Corsica or Barcelona.</p></li>\n</ul><p>Is this a culture that resonates with you? Can you contribute something to make fournova even better? Yes and yes? Then please get in touch with us!</p>\n</div>",
